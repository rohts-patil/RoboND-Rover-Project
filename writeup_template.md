## Project: Search and Sample Return
### Writeup Template: You can use this file as a template for your writeup if you want to submit it as a markdown file, but feel free to use some other method and submit a pdf if you prefer.

**The goals / steps of this project are the following:**  

**Training / Calibration**  

* Download the simulator and take data in "Training Mode"
* Test out the functions in the Jupyter Notebook provided
* Add functions to detect obstacles and samples of interest (golden rocks)
* Fill in the `process_image()` function with the appropriate image processing steps (perspective transform, color threshold etc.) to get from raw images to a map.  The `output_image` you create in this step should demonstrate that your mapping pipeline works.
* Use `moviepy` to process the images in your saved dataset with the `process_image()` function.  Include the video you produce as part of your submission.

**Autonomous Navigation / Mapping**

* Fill in the `perception_step()` function within the `perception.py` script with the appropriate image processing functions to create a map and update `Rover()` data (similar to what you did with `process_image()` in the notebook). 
* Fill in the `decision_step()` function within the `decision.py` script with conditional statements that take into consideration the outputs of the `perception_step()` in deciding how to issue throttle, brake and steering commands. 
* Iterate on your perception and decision function until your rover does a reasonable (need to define metric) job of navigating and mapping.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/916/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.

### First Rubric Item

### Pipeline (single images)

####
A.First I took perspective transform of the Rover Front View Image. This transform gives us a birds eye view. 
B.Then using threshold of colors find obstacles, terrain and rock images. For thresholding I used RGB valuse of [160,160,160].
C.Convert them into rover-centric and then into world coordinates.
D.Map them accordingly with differrent colors on the worldmap.

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

1. Most of the time went into decision.py because we need to consider each and every scenario where the robot would move.
2. In this code the robot can not pick up the rocks.
